            <h2>California will become the first state to guarantee free health care for all low-income immigrants living in the country illegally, a move that will provide coverage for an additional 764,000 people at an eventual cost of about $2.7 billion a year.</h2>
            <p>It's part of a $307.9 billion operating budget that Gov. Gavin Newsom was expected to sign Thursday. It pledges to make low-income adults eligible for the state's Medicaid program by 2024, regardless of their immigration status. It's a long-sought victory for health care and immigration activists, who have been asking for the change for more than a decade.</p>
            <p>Nationwide, federal and state governments join together to give free health care to low-income adults and children through Medicaid. But the federal government won't pay for people who are living in the country illegally. Some states, including California, have used their own tax dollars to cover a portion of health care expenses for some low-income immigrants.</p>
            <p>Now, California wants to be the first to do that for everyone.</p>
            <p>About 92% of Californians currently have some form of health insurance, putting the state in the middle of the pack nationally. But that will change once this budget is fully implemented, as adults living in the country illegally make up one of the largest group of people without insurance in the state.</p>
            <h2>People living in the country illegally made up about 7% of the population nationwide in 2020, or about 22.1 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care nonprofit</h2>
            <p>Immigrants have slowly been getting access to some health care programs. Eighteen states now provide prenatal care to people regardless of their immigration status, while the District of Columbia and five states — California, Illinois, New York, Oregon and Washington — cover all children from low-income families regardless of their immigration status. California and Illinois have expanded Medicaid to cover older adult immigrants.</p>
            <p>In California, Republicans and conservative groups have opposed expanding health care to immigrants living in the country illegally. Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said offering free health care will make California "a magnet for those who are not legally authorized to enter the country."</p>
            <blockquote>"This will represent the biggest expansion of coverage in the nation since the start of the Affordable Care Act in 2014," said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a statewide consumer health care advocacy group. "In California we recognize (that) everybody benefits when everyone is covered."</blockquote>
            <h2>Previous expansions of California's Medicaid system have taken six months to a year to implement. But the Newsom administration says it needs a year and a half to complete this expansion because it is so much larger than the previous ones.</h2>
            <p>Health care advocates say the gap in coverage is significant for low-income immigrants living in the country illegally because they don't have other options. Citizens who lose their Medicaid coverage can purchase coverage from Covered California, the state-run health insurance exchange, and likely qualify for a significant discount.</p>
            <p>"But for this population, that's it. (Medicaid) is the only public program available to them," said Sarah Dar, director of health and public benefits policy for the California Immigrant Policy Center.</p>
            <p>Democrats in the state Legislature say they are working with the Newsom administration on speeding up the process.</p>
